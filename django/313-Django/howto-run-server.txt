1. open a new terminal and cd to first_project
(path should be this: PS C:\...\GitHub\313-Django-Intro\django\313-Django\first_project> )
2. run this command: python manage.py runserver
3. It should output something that says:
...
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:800/  <-- (if you are running django more than once, the ip will increment)
...
4. either copy and paste that link into the browser, or click the link and there should be a hover box that says "follow link" and you can click that.
